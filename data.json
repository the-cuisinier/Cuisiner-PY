Stirring constantly and scraping back any foam that clings to the side of the pan, let this mixture boil for about 1 minute. Remove from the heat and let cool while, in a separate bowl, you beat the eggs until creamy. \n\nWhen the boiled syrup has cooled, beat in the eggs, salt and pecans. Pour into the unbaked pie shell and bake for about 50 minutes.\n\nNotes:\n\n* A little cream (about 1/4 to 1/2 cup) mixed into a pecan pie filling before baking gives it a richer, lighter texture. \n\n* For a sweeter, lighter pie: add more sugar and use fewer pecans; for a denser, less sweet pie: add more pecans and use less sugar. \n\n* The buttery flavour and the lard-induced flakiness of a butter and lard crust make it the perfect one for a perfect pecan pie. And a Southern pecan pie authority I know suggests that you roll out the dough a little thicker than usual; a thick, richly shortened crust provides an appetizing balance to the sweetness of the filling.

Once the cake can be unmolded, remove from the pan and cut into 1\u00bd\" sections.

Pat into a ball, flatten slightly, wrap in waxed paper or plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 30 minutes or as long as overnight.\n\nWork on a lightly floured surface.  Keep the dough lightly dusted with flour.  Roll dough into a sheet about 1/16-inch thick.  Gently roll dough up into a cylinder.  With a slicing knife, cut crosswise in 1/4-inch slices.  Dust dough with semolina and unwrap noodles.  Cover with a tea towel until ready to cook.  (The past may be made an hour ahead of time or frozen for up to 1 month.  Defrost in refrigerator.)

        "instructions": "Place the rice in a bowl. Add cold water to cover and wash the rice well by rubbing it between your hands, then drain. Repeat twice more. Pour the rice into a strainer to drain.\n\nPlace the rinsed rice and the 2 cups water in a 2 to 3-quart saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat, reduce the heat to low, cover and cook for 20 minutes. Turn off the heat and let the rice stand for 10 minutes.\n\nIn a small pan, heat the vinegar, sugar, mirin and salt over medium heat until the sugar dissolves. Remove from the heat.\n\nTurn out the cooked rice into a large wooden or plastic bowl, and pour the vinegar mixture evenly over the rice. Fold the liquid in with a wooden rice paddle. At the same time, fan the rice to bring out the luster of the grains. Continue fanning and folding until the rice absorbs all the liquid. Cover with a damp cloth and let stand until ready to use. It will hold at room temperature for up to 4 hours.\n\nYield: about 4 cups",
